    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "In the last few months of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the entire world to adapt. Due to the virus, meetings and lectures were hosted online, and people were not allowed to go to offices. The use of public transport and motorways dropped accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This report will explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the usage of these modes of transport, the recovery in the years after, and a forecast of transport use in the future years.\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "The main objective of this study is to analyze how the performance of different transport modes in the Netherlands was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how they have recovered since. The study aims to provide insights into:\n",
    "- The relative impact of COVID-19 on different modes of passenger transport (car, local public transport (bus, tram, metro), trains, bicycle, and walking).\n",
    "- Regional variations in recovery between urban and rural areas.\n",
    "- Regional variations in recovery per province\n",
    "- Forecasting future transport performance and identifying when levels are expected to return to pre-COVID (2019) levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1  Data pipeline\n",
    "- Importing data from the CBS CSV files\n",
    "- Structuring and organizing relevant data\n",
    "- Creating line plots that show the trends\n",
    "- Creating a plot for travel data of the Netherlands for regional differences\n",
    "- Comparing data for the province and the city/rural environment.\n",
    "- Creating a forecast for the future\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Data Sources\n",
    "CBS Open data StatLine – Totale vervoersprestatie in Nederland; vervoerwijzen, regio’s\n",
    "\thttps://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84687NED/table?ts=1759138063\n",
    "\n",
    "The CBS dataset 84687NED – Transport Performance in the Netherlands provides annual figures on the total number of kilometers traveled within the Netherlands, broken down by transport mode (car, public transport, bicycle, freight/other) and by region (provinces and degree of urbanization). The data, collected through the ODiN survey, covers residents aged six and older. In our study, we will use this dataset to compare transport performance across modes before, during, and after COVID-19 with 2019 as a baseline, to assess regional differences between urban and rural areas and to examine recovery trends over time in order to forecast developments up to 2030.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CBS Mobiliteit; per persoon, persoonskenmerken, motieven en regio’s (woon-werk verkeer)\n",
    "https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/84713NED/table\n",
    "\n",
    "The CBS dataset 84713NED – Mobility by person, personal characteristics, motives and regions provides detailed data on individual mobility behavior in the Netherlands, including the number of trips, distances, transport modes, motives (such as commuting, shopping, leisure), and breakdowns by personal and regional characteristics. In our study we will focus especially on home-work (commuting) travel data: how many trips or kilometers are made for commuting, what transport modes are used, and how this varies across regions and over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3 Geographical Scale\n",
    "By keeping the scope within the Netherlands it is possible to compare the transportation data for the different regions in the Netherlands. Because the different regions often largely differ in the amount of urban and rural areas it is possible to research if urban or rural areas could better cope with the impacts of COVID-19 on the various transportation modes. \n",
    "- National coverage: Netherlands.\n",
    "- Subdivisions: Comparison across regions and between urban and rural areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.4 Temporal Scale\n",
    "The data from the two datasets is from 2018 to 2023. This then includes the data in the years before COVID-19 where the values can be used to describe the “normal” transportation levels before the pandemic. It also includes the years during the pandemic, which show how the transportation levels were affected by COVID-19. Lastly, it includes the years in which the transportation levels slowly returned back to “normal”. \n",
    "- Early data: 2018-2019\n",
    "- Main COVID-19 impact years: 2020–2022.\n",
    "- Recovery analysis: 2023–2024.\n",
    "- Forecast horizon: 2025–2030.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Research Questions\n",
    "Main question:\\\n",
    "How were different transport mode performances affected, did they recover after COVID-19 and how was the recovery process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-questions:\n",
    "- How did the transport performance of different modes of transport change during and after the corona period (2020–2022) compared to 2019?\n",
    "- Which transport modes show the largest recovery compared to pre-COVID levels?\n",
    "- Are there significant differences in the degree of recovery between urban and rural regions in the Netherlands?\n",
    "- Are there significant differences in the degree of recovery between provinces in the Netherlands?\n",
    "- Based on historical trends, how is transport performance likely to develop over the next five years (2025–2030), and if or when will each mode of transport return to pre-COVID levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Answering the research questions\n",
    "#### 3.1 How did the transport performance of different modes of transport change during and after the corona period (2020-2022) compared to 2019?\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in figure 1 the transport performance of the various transport modes experienced a significant dip between 2019 and 2020. This was due to the emergency policies and regulations introduced by the Dutch government to suppress the spread of COVID-19 in the Netherlands. Because of the policies most people had to work from home and it was not allowed to visit family and friends. After the corona period, transport performance started to recover again as more and more people returned back to normal everyday life. The total transport performance however never fully recovered to the values before COVID-19 indicating that some people never returned to their original schedule.\n",

    "  <em>Figure 1: Performance of transport modes between 2018 and 2023.</em>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.2 Which transport modes show the largest recovery compared to pre-COVID levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to figure 1, figure 2 shows the relative change in transport performance per travel mode. Figure 2 shows clearly that every transport mode experienced a decrease in performance except for walking. This is because walking became a popular activity for people during the corona period to still go outside and have some form of exercise. It was also an activity for people to break the long days of only staying inside their own homes.  \n",

    "  <em>Figure 2: Recovery of the performance of transport modes.</em>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.3 Are there significant differences in the degree of recovery between urban and rural regions in the Netherlands?\n",
    "\n",
    "Both graphs show that travel performance dropped sharply in 2020 due to COVID-19 and then slowly recovered between 2021 and 2023. Figure 3 shows similar patterns for all urbanisation levels, but highly urbanised areas recovered a bit faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Figure 4, the categories were grouped as follows:\n",
    "“Extremely urbanised,” “Strongly urbanised,” and “Moderately urbanised” were combined into Urban, while “Hardly urbanised” and “Not urbanised” were combined into Rural.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 4 confirms this: urban areas show slightly higher recovery levels than rural areas after 2020. The difference is small, so the recovery trend is mostly the same across the country.\n",
    "\n",
    "To awnser the question:\n",
    "\n",
    "Urban regions recovered a bit quicker than rural ones, but the overall recovery pattern in the Netherlands is very similar for all regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphs/Degrees of urbanization.png\" width=\"800\"><br>\n",
    "  <em>Figure 3: Recovery by degree of urbanization.</em>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "  <div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphs/Degrees of urbanization grouped.png\" width=\"800\"><br>\n",
    "  <em>Figure 4: Recovery by degree of urbanization grouped.</em>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.4 Are there significant differences in the degree of recovery between provinces in the Netherlands? \n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the recovery index generated for question 3.3, differences in recovery per province can be determined. As seen in Figure 5, there are significant differences between provinces. However, there is no visible division between rural and urban provinces. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "  <img src=\"Graphs/Recovery per province.png\" width=\"800\"><br>\n",
    "  <em>Figure 5: Recovery of the transport performance per province.</em>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "In Groningen and Fryslan, changes in relative total travel recovered the weakest, ranging only from 80 to 85 percent. Drenthe ranges between 95 to 100 percent. Even though the total recovery for these urbanisation degrees differ from eachother, there is no noticable pattern when comparing the provinces individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the question: In this chart, there are indeed significant differences in the degree of recovery between provinces, but there is no visible pattern based on the degree of urbanisation in these provinces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.5 Based on historical trends, how is transport performance likely to develop over the next five years (2025–2030), and if or when will each mode of transport return to pre-COVID levels?"
