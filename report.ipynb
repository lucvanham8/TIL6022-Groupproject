    "# The Recovery of Transport Performance After COVID-19\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "In the last few months of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic caused the entire world to adapt. Due to the virus, meetings and lectures were hosted online, and people were not allowed to go to offices. The use of public transport and motorways dropped accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "This report will explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the usage of these modes of transport, the recovery in the years after, and a forecast of transport use in the future years.\n",
    "Objectives\n",
    "The main objective of this study is to analyze how the performance of different transport modes in the Netherlands was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and how they have recovered since. The study aims to provide insights into:\n",
    "- The relative impact of COVID-19 on different modes of passenger transport (car, local public transport (bus, tram, metro), trains, bicycle, and walking).\n",
    "- Regional variations in recovery between urban and rural areas.\n",
    "- Regional variations in recovery per province\n",
    "- Forecasting future transport performance and identifying when levels are expected to return to pre-COVID (2019) levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Research Questions\n",
    "Main question:\\\n",
    "How were different transport mode performances affected, did they recover after COVID-19 and how was the recovery process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sub-questions:\n",
    "- How did the transport performance of different modes of transport change during and after the corona period (2020–2022) compared to 2019?\n",
    "- Which transport modes show the largest recovery compared to pre-COVID levels?\n",
    "- Are there significant differences in the degree of recovery between urban and rural regions in the Netherlands?\n",
    "- Are there significant differences in the degree of recovery between provinces in the Netherlands?\n",
    "- Based on historical trends, how is transport performance likely to develop over the next five years (2025–2030), and if or when will each mode of transport return to pre-COVID levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Answering the research questions\n",
